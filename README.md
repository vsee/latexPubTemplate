# Latex Publication Project Template

This project template can be used for publications build with Latex. It uses [ACM Taco](http://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) as example style which can easily be replaced by a different one.

The template supports the following features:

* Makefile
* out of source build (gen directory contains generated files)
* data extraction
* figure generation from SVG (figures directory)
* figure generation using scripts (tools directory)
